# Instructions
# In this exercise, we'll develop a simple control system for a nuclear reactor.

# For a reactor to produce the power it must be in a state of criticality. 
# If the reactor is in a state less than criticality, it can become damaged. 
# If the reactor state goes beyond criticality, it can overload and result in a meltdown. 
# We want to mitigate the chances of meltdown and correctly manage reactor state.
