# Determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
# An equilateral triangle has all three sides the same length.
# An isosceles triangle has at least two sides the same length. 
# (It is sometimes specified as having exactly two sides the same length, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll say at least two.)
# A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.
